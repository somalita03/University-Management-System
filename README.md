🎓 University Information System (SQL Project)
📌 Overview

This project implements a University Information System using SQLite in Google Colab. It simulates real-world academic and administrative workflows, including student enrollments, professor assignments, course management, library borrowings, scholarships, attendance tracking, and club memberships.

The project demonstrates SQL skills such as schema design, joins, groupings, aggregate queries, GPA calculations, and integration with Pandas + Matplotlib for analytics and visualization.

⚙️ Features

Relational Database Schema with 10+ tables (Students, Professors, Courses, Departments, Enrollments, Library, Borrowings, Clubs, Memberships, Scholarships, Attendance).

Core Operations: Student enrollments, professor teaching load, course popularity, grade distribution.

Advanced Analytics:

GPA per student & department

Most borrowed library books

Club participation statistics

Attendance analysis (e.g., students with >90% attendance)

Visualizations: Department-wise GPA comparison, course popularity charts.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Database: SQLite (in-memory, portable)

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: Python sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib

🚀 How to Run

Open the project notebook in Google Colab.

Run all cells to create tables, insert sample data, and execute SQL queries.

Explore the results in tabular form and interactive visualizations.

📊 Example Queries

List all students with their departments.

Show student enrollments with courses and professors.

Calculate GPA per student and department.

Find the most borrowed library books.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience in SQL schema design and query writing.

Integration of SQL with data analysis & visualization tools.

Understanding of how databases support academic management systems.

✨ This project showcases SQL not just for CRUD operations but also for data-driven insights that assist in university decision-making.
